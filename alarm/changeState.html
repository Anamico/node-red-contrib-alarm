    <h3>Alarm Control Collector</h3>
    <p>When you need to change the alarm mode or state, send a message to this node.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: This node can receive from multiple sources, BUT do NOT mix Homekit bridge Security System nodes and other nodes.</p>
    <p>If receiving from a homekit bridge security system node, select the "Homekit" checkbox. This is REQUIRED. If you don't do this, the node will auto-shutdown the first time it
       receives a message from a homekit device. This is because it's expecting to NOT receive a homekit device message and doing so breaks functionality. Essentially, when
       homekit receives a message, it will echo it on the output, so we need to say it's coming from a homekit device to be able to determine if it's an instruction or an echo and
       handle it appropriately.</p>
    <p>If NOT receiving from a homekit bridge security system node, then make sure you DON'T set this option, it will essentially drop all traffic as it appears it's not an instruction
       from homekit.</p>
